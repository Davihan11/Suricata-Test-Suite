Generic visualisation of Suricata counter values from stats/eve.json files.

Reads one or more eve.json (or eve-stats.json) files, filters the per-line
``stats`` records with a universal jq filter, extracts the requested counter
paths and plots them over time (using ``.stats.uptime`` as the x-axis).

Example:
    python3 util/visualize.py -i stats.json -p flow.memuse -p stream.memuse \\
        -f 'uptime > 30'

Multiple input files can be given (each ``-i`` adds another file); each input
is plotted as its own labelled series on the same plot.

When several series have very different Y scales (e.g. ``pkts`` next to
``bytes``), the smaller ones are automatically moved to a secondary Y axis so
they are not flattened out of view. Use ``--no-secondary-axis`` to disable
this, or ``--secondary-axis-threshold`` to tune the detection.
